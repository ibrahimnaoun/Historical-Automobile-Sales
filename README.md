## 📊 Dataset  
- **Source**: Historical automobile sales data (e.g., from government databases, industry reports, or Kaggle).  
- **Features**: Includes car sales data such as make, model, year, region, price, units sold, and more.  
- **Objective**: Visualize trends and patterns in automobile sales, and create interactive maps showing regional sales distribution.

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries  
- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for static data visualizations like bar charts, histograms, and line plots).  
  - **Folium** (for creating interactive maps and geographic visualizations).  
  - **Pandas & Numpy** (for data manipulation).

## 🛠️ Key Steps  
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data by handling missing values, filtering out outliers, and preparing it for visualization.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze trends, seasonal effects, and key statistics in the automobile sales data.  
3. **Static Visualizations**:  
   - Create line plots and bar charts with Matplotlib to visualize overall sales trends.  
   - Use Seaborn to generate heatmaps and pair plots for deeper insights.  
4. **Geographical Visualization**:  
   - Use Folium to create interactive maps that show regional automobile sales distribution.  
5. **Insight Generation**: Visualize correlations between variables and gain insights into the factors affecting automobile sales.
